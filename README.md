# Project Management API

Welcome to the Project Management API documentation! This API allows users to manage projects and clients, providing endpoints for various operations such as registering users, logging in, adding clients, retrieving project details, and more.

To explore the API and its capabilities, please refer to the [API Documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/20890518/2s93m4Y3XV). The documentation provides detailed information about each API endpoint, including the request structure, required parameters, and example responses.

## Authentication

The API requires authentication for most endpoints. Users can register and log in to obtain an access token, which should be included in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer Token for subsequent requests. Please refer to the API documentation for the specific authentication process.

## Technologies Used

The API is built using a combination of RESTful API and GraphQL technologies. RESTful endpoints are used for user authentication, while GraphQL endpoints provide more flexibility for managing clients and projects. This hybrid approach allows for efficient data retrieval and manipulation.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Project Management API, follow these steps:

1. Register a new user by sending a POST request to the registration endpoint.
2. Log in as a user by sending a POST request to the login endpoint and obtaining the access token.
3. Use the access token in the `Authorization` header for subsequent requests to authenticate and access protected endpoints.
4. Explore the API endpoints provided in the documentation to manage clients and projects, including adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting data.
